the users sent to the server. 

An error log is a record of all of the errors encountered by a server as well as startup and shutdown messages.

A slow query log contains the SQL statements that take a long time to execute which may need to be rewritten.

A binary log contains a series of binary files that represent changes made to the database, which can be used to 
restore the database if it crashes.
