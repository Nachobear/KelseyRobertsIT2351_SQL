 Query Review:
 
 Getting the create_my_guitar_shop file from the website, editing it and opening it in MySQL went smoothly. I refreshed the schema window and the database was there.
 
 I made a few mistakes with my first insert statement, creating messy entries in my result set. I then learned that to start fresh, I had to right-click on the database in the schemas window and click "drop schema" and "drop now" to clear out its data and then I would run the create_my_guitar_shop file again to recreate it. I think the "drop database" line in the create_my_guitar_shop file wasn't getting rid of the data. After that I wrote a select statement to show a result set of the whole table so I could check if it worked. It took me a few attempts to get the line added correctly. At first I thought it was a mistake that the address ids were null but then I realized that that was what they were supposed to be.
