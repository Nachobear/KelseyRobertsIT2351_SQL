Executive Summary

This assignment included creating databases by running a slightly customized version of a previously written .sql file that was downloaded from the textbook website and writing and executing simple SQL scripts to retrieve data from tables as result sets.

MySQL Workbench

I downloaded the program (not virtual machine) and I have no previous experience with the program or SQL.

Queries

At first I was unsure if I needed to write a command to select a database before I had to write the SELECT command. I tried the SELECT command by itself and got an error telling me to double-click a database. Then I was unsure where the "customer" table was but soon I realized I should look throught the code in the create_databases file to see what database it was created under. After that I double-clicked the OrderManagement database and the commands from the book worked just fine.

Conclusion

I am happy I was able to work out all the obstacles I ran into during this first assignment without having to contact the Professor. It just took a lot more time than I expected though and a lot of reading. It has been a long time since I used Github and I have never fully understood how it works but hopefully that will change with this class. Getting used to the layout of Workbench and Github were the difficult parts. Also it was overwhelming to have to jump between instructions on as many as 15 different windows to complete the assignment.
